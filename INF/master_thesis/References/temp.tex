The new generation of the collaborative robots allow the use of small robot arms working in an asynchronous or synchronous fashion with human workers.  Such an example of the collaborative robot is the YuMi robot, dual 7-DOF robot arms designed for precise manipulation of small parts better known in computer vision as rigid body. For further acceptance of such robots in the industry, some methods and sensors systems have to be developed to allow them to pick parts without the position of the part being known in advance, just as humans do.
This thesis is focused on the implementation of an algorithm for determing the positition of the known parts. We first deal with a robot-camera calibration, then  we propose a method to obtain the ground truth position of known parts. As step in between a 3D model of the known part needs to be created.
